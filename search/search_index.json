The snake game is a common programming project used to practice certain concepts such as object-oriented programming and array manipulation. There are a lot of SenseHat snake game implementations online, this version attempts to program the game in an easier and well documented way, whilst leaving room for further amends/improvements. Hardware and software Hardware The following hardware components are required for this project: Raspberry Pi 3/4 and respective power supply SenseHat add-on board Monitor HDMI cable (depending on the version of RPi in use) Mouse and keyboard Software Raspberry Pi OS is the operating system used on the Raspberry Pi 4. The download and installation procedure can be found here . Python 3 and the SenseHat library were employed in programming the game. SenseHat setup The SenseHat is equipped with the following sensors and components: Accelerometer Magnetometer Gyroscope Humidity sensor Temperature sensor Pressure sensor 8x8 RGB LED matrix and Five-button joystick However, only the joystick and 8x8 LED matrix will be used for the game. The images below show SenseHat connected to the Raspberry Pi using standoffs. The white cable on the left powers the Pi while the one on the right is the HDMI cable connected to the desktop monitor. The wireless mouse and keyboard (not shown below) are connected to the Pi via the black Logitech receiver inserted into one of the Raspberry Pi's USB ports. Snake game brief The snake game starts out with a size of one pixel moving in a default position, to the right in this case. A few milliseconds later, food is spawned for the snake to consume. With each successive food ingestion, the snake's tail grows by one pixel and the snake's moves at a faster pace. Once the snake bites any part of its body, the game is over. The diagram below (courtesy of Raspberry Pi Projects ) shows the SenseHat LED matrix coordinates. The summary of the snake game is illustrated in the flow chart below. To ensure that the snake moves in out of boundaries of the LED matrix correctly, border control is implemented for each move. Video demonstration The snake game implementation can be seen by clicking the image below. SenseHat Emulator The snake game can be tested and played online by pasting code in the snake_game.py file into a SenseHat emulator at Trinket .","title":"Raspberry Pi Sensehat Snake game"},{"location":"index.html#raspberry-pi-sensehat-snake-game","text":"This is a remake of the popular retro snake game on a Raspberry Pi 4 equipped with a SenseHat add-on board.
